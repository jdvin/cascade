GameNGen applied to falling sands.

Falling Sand implementation taken from https://github.com/Antiochian/Falling-Sand/tree/master

## Rough Plan:

- [ ] Implement falling sands such that:
    - [ ] It can be played and the physics behaviour can be verified
    - [ ] It can be run in 'simulation' mode whereby an arbitrary number of game instances can be computer controlled at once and have their frames recorded
    - [ ] The backend can be swapped for a model that sends rending instructions to pygame
        - Query: Is pygame the best way to do this?
- [ ] Construct a dataset
- [ ] Construct a model
